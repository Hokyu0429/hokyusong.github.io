Abstract: 'Abstract: This paper investigates the evidence and implications of financial synergies in mergers and acquisitions (M\&A). Financial synergies arise when one firm's superior financial condition benefits another firm that is financially constrained but expects a higher return on investment. Using micro data from the SDC M\&A database, I find that the target's average revenue product of capital (arpk) exceeds that of the acquirer, implying that the target's capital investment return is higher than the acquirer's. This finding is not consistent with the conventional wisdom from average q in M\&A, which suggests that M\&A is a process of capital reallocation from targets to acquirers. To explain the puzzle and assess its aggregate implications, I develop a dynamic general equilibrium M\&A search model with financial frictions. I reconcile the two contradicting statistics in the calibrated model and show that the investment implication by average q can be misleading. In the model, I find that financial synergy accounts for an average of 63\% of the merger surplus, and M\&A results in a 7\% increase in output and a 4.5\% gain in TFP. Strikingly, 89\% of the TFP gain is attributed to the reduction of capital misallocation. However, M\&As result in a reduced number of firms and entrants, while also increasing the financial polarization among firms.'
